##Welcome to my Web Development Bootcamp journey! ðŸš€

I started this bootcamp to transition into the world of web development, where Iâ€™ve learned how to build dynamic, responsive websites from scratch. The bootcamp covered essential topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, other frameworks,libraries and best practices for version control with Git. During this process, I created a number of real-world projects, each helping me sharpen my skills and build a strong foundation in front-end development.

Bootcamp Overview
The bootcamp kicked off with an introduction to HTML and CSS, where I learned to structure and style web pages. We then moved into JavaScript to add interactivity to the projects, followed by learning about version control with Git to manage project changes effectively. The bootcamp was hands-on, with a focus on building projects that are practical and can be showcased in a professional portfolio.
